[Data Danny](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/) offers an 8 week SQL Challenge.  This repo will have a folder for each week, in which you will find:
* the questions 
* the sample data in a file called `schema.sql` which is modified to work in BigQuery.
* the solutions to MOST of the questions... maybe I'll leave some for you to attempt on your own.  But feel free to make a PR and contribute your own solution.
